                <h1>ABOUT</h1>
                Ted Lasso is an American sports comedy-drama television series developed by Jason Sudeikis, Bill Lawrence, Brendan Hunt and Joe Kelly, based on a character that Sudeikis first portrayed in a series of promotional media for NBC Sports' coverage of England's Premier League. The show follows Ted Lasso, an American college football coach who is hired to coach an English soccer team with the secret intention that his inexperience will lead it to failure, but whose folksy, optimistic leadership proves unexpectedly successful.
                The first season of ten episodes premiered on Apple TV+ on August 14, 2020, with three episodes followed by weekly installments. A second season of 12 episodes premiered on July 23, 2021. In October 2020, the series was renewed for a third season, which premiered on March 15, 2023.               
                The series has received critical acclaim, with particular praise for its performances (particularly Sudeikis, Hannah Waddingham, Brett Goldstein, and Juno Temple), humor, writing, themes, and uplifting tone. Among other accolades, its first season was nominated for 20 Primetime Emmy Awards, becoming the most nominated first-season comedy in Emmy Award history. Sudeikis, Waddingham and Goldstein won for their performances, and the series won the 2021 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series. Sudeikis also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series.

                Jason Sudeikis as Ted Lasso, an American college football coach who is hired to coach AFC Richmond, an English soccer team. He is frequently ridiculed for his folksy optimism and inexperience with the sport, but gradually wins people over through his kind, hopeful, and compassionate approach to coaching.
                Hannah Waddingham as Rebecca Welton, the new owner of AFC Richmond. Kind yet vindictive, she initially hires Lasso as a ploy to sabotage the team, but eventually comes to appreciate him.

                Phil Dunster as Jamie Tartt, a talented but egotistical young up-and-coming striker.
                Brett Goldstein as Roy Kent, a veteran box-to-box midfielder, captain and later assistant coach of AFC Richmond. Kent is primarily based on hot-headed Irish former footballer Roy Keane.[8]

                Sarah Niles as Dr. Sharon Fieldstone (season 2; recurring season 3), a sports psychologist.
                Anthony Head as Rupert Mannion (season 3; recurring season 1; guest season 2), Rebecca's philandering ex-husband, the former owner of AFC Richmond, and the current owner of West Ham United.[9]

                Kola Bokinni as Isaac McAdoo (season 3; recurring seasons 1–2), a center-back who is the vice-captain, later promoted to captain.
                Billy Harris as Colin Hughes (season 3; recurring seasons 1–2), a young Welsh left winger who is closeted.
                James Lance as Trent Crimm (season 3; recurring seasons 1–2), a skeptical reporter formerly working for The Independent before being fired in the second season after revealing Nate was the anonymous source who leaked Ted's panic attack; in the third season, he is writing a book about the club.
